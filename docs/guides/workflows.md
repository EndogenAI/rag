# Agent Workflows

Formalized workflows for the EndogenAI project. Each workflow defines the sequence of agents,
gates that must pass before advancing, human review checkpoints, and GitHub issue conventions
for showing work permanently.

The overarching pattern at every level of every workflow is **expansion → contraction**:
expand broadly during discovery, then contract into precise, durable outputs. This maps
directly to design thinking methodology and is the endogenic approach to all knowledge work.

## Handoff Architecture

Three interlocking patterns govern how agents hand off to each other. Together they produce
**value coherence** across the fleet — agents produce consistent, well-grounded outputs not
because they share a single rule, but because each layer encodes the same context and passes
it forward in denser form.

### 1. Self-Loop Phase Gates

Executive agents have handoff buttons that target **themselves** — one per phase boundary.
After a sub-agent completes its task and returns control, the executive clicks the self-loop
button to enter a deliberate review step before deciding the next delegation.

```
Human → Executive
           ↓ (delegate)
        Sub-agent A
           ↓ (takeback)
        Executive  ← self-loop button fires here: "✓ A done — review & decide"
           ↓ (delegate)
        Sub-agent B
           ↓ (takeback)
        Executive  ← self-loop button fires here: "✓ B done — review & decide"
           ↓
        Review → GitHub
```

**Why this matters**: the self-loop button pre-fills a prompt that orients the executive to
the just-completed output and the decision to be made. It enforces a review pause that prevents
sub-agent output from propagating unchecked into the next phase.

**Authoring rule**: every executive agent should have one self-loop handoff per phase boundary,
labeled `✓ <Phase> done — review & decide`. The prompt should name where to find the output
and what the gate criteria are.

### 2. Prompt Enrichment Chain

Each delegation level enriches the prompt with progressively denser project context:

```
Human           sparse intent
    ↓
Executive       reads scratchpad + OPEN_RESEARCH.md + AGENTS.md
                → emits a richer, grounded, scoped prompt
    ↓
Sub-agent       reads specialist sources + executive prompt
                → emits a precisely targeted instruction
    ↓
Specialist      executes with full context
```

This is the endogenous-first principle in practice. Context already encoded in the repo
(guides, prior session scratchpad, AGENTS.md guardrails) is absorbed at each level and
re-emitted in the next delegation — so work at the leaves is grounded in the full project
knowledge base, not just the human's initial message.

**Implication for prompt authoring**: handoff `prompt:` fields should leave room for the
receiving agent to apply its own encoded knowledge. Specific enough to convey context;
general enough not to over-constrain.

### 3. Quasi-Encapsulated Sub-Fleets

Sub-agents default to **returning to their executive** (takeback), but may escalate directly
to another agent in exceptional cases — when the executive's context is insufficient or the
issue crosses fleet boundaries.

| Route | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `Sub-agent → Executive` | Default: always return for the review gate |
| `Sub-agent → Executive Docs` | Exceptional: output directly implies a doc change the executive can't handle |
| `Sub-agent → Review` | Exceptional: quality issue requiring an immediate gate before any further work |

**Anti-patterns**:
- **Full encapsulation** — sub-agents can never escalate: too rigid, breaks on edge cases.
- **Free-chaining** — sub-agents route freely to any next agent: loses executive oversight.

The hybrid model gives fleets quasi-autonomy while keeping the executive in oversight as the
default path.

## Research Workflow

The research workflow converts an open question into a committed synthesis document in
`docs/research/`. It is orchestrated by the **Executive Researcher** and proceeds through
four specialist sub-agents.

### Trigger

A GitHub issue tagged `research` exists, or the Executive Researcher identifies a knowledge
gap that requires structured investigation.

### Phases

```
Orient → Frame → Scout (expand) → Synthesize (contract) → Review → Archive → Notify
```

---

### Phase 1 — Orient

**Agent**: Executive Researcher  
**Gate before advancing**: session scratchpad initialized; `OPEN_RESEARCH.md` read; no duplicate issue exists

```bash
uv run python scripts/prune_scratchpad.py --init
```

Read:
- `.tmp/<branch>/<date>.md` — prior session context
- `docs/research/OPEN_RESEARCH.md` — existing research queue and gate deliverables
- Open GitHub issues tagged `research`

**Human checkpoint**: confirm the research question is correctly scoped before delegating.

---

### Phase 2 — Frame

**Agent**: Executive Researcher  
**Output**: written to session scratchpad `## Research Frame` section

Write a concise research frame:

```markdown
## Research Frame — <Topic>

**Question**: What are we trying to learn?
**Good answer looks like**: <description of satisfying answer>
**Gate deliverables**: D1, D2, D3 (from OPEN_RESEARCH.md)
**Scoping constraints**: <e.g., local compute only; no cloud services>
**Endogenous sources already read**: <list>
```

**Gate before advancing**: frame committed to scratchpad; deliverables identified.

---

### Phase 3 — Scout (Expansion)

**Agent**: Research Scout  
**Invocation prompt**: *"Please survey [topic] and catalogue all relevant sources, links, and raw findings into the active session scratchpad under '## Scout Output'. Do not synthesize — gather only. Seed references: [paste from OPEN_RESEARCH.md]"*

**What Scout does**:
1. Reads local sources first (endogenous-first).
2. Surveys external sources: fetches pages, reads abstracts, follows references up to 2 levels deep.
3. Catalogues findings in a structured table — no interpretation.

**Scout Output format**:

```markdown
## Scout Output — <Topic> — <Date>

### Sources Surveyed

| # | Title | URL | Relevance |
|---|-------|-----|-----------|

### Key Raw Findings
- ...

### Leads for Follow-Up
- [ ] URL or reference
```

**Gate before advancing**: at least 3–5 relevant sources catalogued; no synthesis present in Scout output; Scout has returned control to Executive Researcher via takeback handoff.

---

### Phase 4 — Synthesize (Contraction)

**Agent**: Research Synthesizer  
**Invocation prompt**: *"Raw sources have been catalogued in the session scratchpad under '## Scout Output'. Please synthesize into a structured research draft in docs/research/<slug>.md following the expansion→contraction pattern. Topic: [topic]. Gate deliverables: [D1, D2, D3]."*

**What Synthesizer does**:
1. Reads Scout output from scratchpad.
2. Drafts `docs/research/<slug>.md` following the standard structure (see `docs/AGENTS.md`).
3. Sets `Status: Draft — pending review`.
4. Returns control to Executive Researcher via takeback handoff.

**Gate before advancing**: draft exists at `docs/research/<slug>.md`; all gate deliverables from `OPEN_RESEARCH.md` are addressed or explicitly deferred to open questions; no raw Scout notes present in the draft.

---

### Phase 5 — Review

**Agent**: Research Reviewer  
**Invocation prompt**: *"A research synthesis draft is ready. Please validate it against the endogenic methodology standards and flag any gaps, unsupported claims, or contradictions. Draft: docs/research/<slug>.md. Gate deliverables: [D1, D2, D3]."*

**What Reviewer checks** (full checklist in `research-reviewer.agent.md`):
- Research question addressed
- Claims cited to sources
- Consistent with `MANIFESTO.md`
- Recommendations are concrete and actionable
- Document is free of raw Scout notes

**Gate before advancing**: Reviewer verdict is **Approved**. If verdict is **Revise**, cycle back to Phase 4. If **Reject**, cycle back to Phase 3.

**Human checkpoint**: Review the Reviewer's findings in the scratchpad before approving to archive.

---

### Phase 6 — Archive

**Agent**: Research Archivist  
**Invocation prompt**: *"Research has been reviewed and approved. Reviewer verdict is in the scratchpad under '## Reviewer Output'. Please finalise docs/research/<slug>.md (Status: Final), route through Review for the commit gate, then commit and push."*

**What Archivist does**:
1. Updates `Status` to `Final`.
2. Routes through **Review** agent for commit gate.
3. Commits: `docs(research): add final synthesis — <topic title>  Closes #<issue>`.
4. Returns control to Executive Researcher.

**Gate before advancing**: commit is pushed; GitHub issue is updated.

---

### Phase 7 — Notify

**Agent**: Executive Researcher → Executive Docs  
**Invocation prompt**: *"Research on [topic] is complete and committed. Please review whether any guides or top-level docs should be updated to reflect the findings."*

Update the GitHub issue with a comment linking to the committed document.
Close the issue or move to the next phase if follow-on work is needed.

---

## Documentation Workflow

Triggered when guides, AGENTS.md files, top-level docs, or MANIFESTO.md need to be updated.
Orchestrated by **Executive Docs**.

```
Orient → Audit → Draft → Validate against MANIFESTO.md → Review → Commit
```

### Key Gates

| Gate | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| Before drafting | Changed triggers identified; `MANIFESTO.md` read; session scratchpad checked |
| Before finalising | No guardrail or constraint silently removed; no new axiom added without grounding |
| Before committing | Routed through **Review** agent; **MANIFESTO.md** changes require explicit user instruction |

---

## Scripting Workflow

Triggered when a task has been done >2 times interactively.
Orchestrated by **Executive Scripter**.

```
Audit scripts/ → Identify gap → Write or extend → Dry-run → Update scripts/README.md → Review → Commit
```

See [`docs/guides/programmatic-first.md`](programmatic-first.md) for the full decision criteria
and [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md) for script conventions.

---

## Gates Reference

A gate is a set of criteria that must be satisfied before an agent or human may advance to the
next phase of a workflow. Gates enforce the **contraction** side of expansion → contraction:
they prevent unfinished work from propagating forward.

### Gate Levels

| Level | Enforced by | Examples |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Phase gate** | Agent checklist (self-enforced) | "Scout output present before synthesizing" |
| **Quality gate** | Review agent | "No unsupported claims; consistent with MANIFESTO.md" |
| **Commit gate** | Review + GitHub agents | "Reviewed and approved before any push" |
| **Human gate** | Explicit checkpoint in workflow | "Human confirms scope before Scout runs" |

### Research Workflow Gate Summary

| Phase | Gate criteria |
|-------|--------------|
| Frame | Research question written; deliverables identified; no duplicate issue |
| Scout | ≥3–5 sources; no synthesis; takeback handoff received |
| Synthesize | Draft exists; deliverables addressed or deferred; no raw notes |
| Review | Reviewer verdict = Approved |
| Archive | Commit pushed; GitHub issue updated |

### Documentation Workflow Gate Summary

| Phase | Gate criteria |
|-------|--------------|
| Draft | Triggers identified; MANIFESTO.md read |
| Finalise | No guardrails silently removed; new axioms grounded in MANIFESTO.md |
| Commit | Review agent approved; MANIFESTO.md changes have user instruction recorded |

---

## GitHub Issue Conventions

Agents use GitHub issues and comments as a **permanent record** — "showing their work" durably,
independent of session scratchpads which are ephemeral.

### Conventions

| Action | Convention |
|--------|-----------|
| Starting work | Comment on the issue: "Beginning Phase 1 — Orient. Branch: `feat/...`" |
| Phase transition | Comment: "Phase N complete. [Brief summary]. Proceeding to Phase N+1." |
| Human checkpoint | Comment: "Human review requested. [What to review + decision needed]." |
| Completing work | Comment with link to committed artifact. Close or move issue to next milestone. |

### Issue Fields for Research Issues

- **Title**: `[Research] <topic>`
- **Label**: `research`
- **Linked branch**: `feat/issue-<N>-<slug>`
- **Assignee**: agent or human responsible for the current phase

---

## Human Review Checkpoints

Explicit points where an agent must stop and wait for human input before continuing.

| Workflow | Checkpoint | What to review |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Research | After Frame phase | Is the research question correctly scoped? Are the gate deliverables right? |
| Research | After Review phase | Review the Reviewer's findings before approving archive |
| Research | Before MANIFESTO.md update | Explicit approval required for any MANIFESTO.md changes |
| Documentation | Any MANIFESTO.md edit | Must have explicit user instruction on record |
| Scripting | Before scripts that delete files | Confirm the `--dry-run` output looks correct |
| Any | Ambiguous or irreversible action | Stop and ask; do not proceed under assumption |

---

## Prompt Library

Standard invocation prompts for recurring handoffs. Copy-paste these when delegating to agents
in Copilot Chat or in handoff `prompt:` fields.
