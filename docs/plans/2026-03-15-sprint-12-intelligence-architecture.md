# Workplan: Research Sprint — Intelligence & Architecture (Sprint 12)

**Branch**: `main`
**Date**: 2026-03-15
**Orchestrator**: Executive Orchestrator

---

## Objective

This sprint sequences 16 open research issues across the Intelligence & Architecture milestone into four dependency-ordered waves. Wave 1 establishes architecture vocabulary (MCP state, service module boundaries, substrate taxonomy) that all later waves depend on. Wave 2 builds on that foundation to explore local inference/RAG, platform agnosticism, and greenfield repo candidates. Wave 3 addresses emergent communication and evolution concerns that require substrate and platform clarity first. Wave 4 closes with content engineering and assessment tooling that can only be specified once the architecture is stable. A final synthesis phase integrates cross-cutting findings from all 16 issues into a single architecture recommendation document. Each wave is followed by a Review gate that must return APPROVED before the next wave begins.
